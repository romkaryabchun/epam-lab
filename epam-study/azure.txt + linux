ansible first

The file needs to have the executable bit set for you. To do this, try using: chmod u+x validate_mapping_file.py
The file needs to begin with a shebang, for example #!/usr/bin/env python3 which will tell the system to run the script using the python3 executable according to your environment
PATH environment variable:
You can add the current directory using export PATH=$PWD:$PATH

#Install python3 and add module psutil
sudo apt-get install gcc python3-dev
pip3 install psutil

If you only need to run a simple script (with a single file), 
you can avoid writing a complete Dockerfile. In the examples below, 
assume you store my_script.py in /usr/src/widget_app/, 
and you want to name the container my-first-python-script:
Python 3:
docker run -it --rm --name my-first-python-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/widget_app python:3 python my_script.py
